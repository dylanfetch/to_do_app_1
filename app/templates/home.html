<p>
        Due to repeated attempts to obtain protected Vault-Tec information, the following security procedures have now been
        instituted:<br><br>

        1. Shutdown of the VTMB01 Masterbrain requires authorization from all three System Operator terminals.<br><br>

        2. All materials of a sensitive nature have been removed from external terminals and access to the Mainframe Room
        requires authorization from all three System Operator terminals.<br><br>

        3. All mechanized security is now being handled by the VTMB01 Masterbrain via security uplink. Please do not tamper
        with this unit without an authorized Service Technician present.<br><br>
    </p>
