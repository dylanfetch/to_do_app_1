<p>
    Due to repeated attempts to obtain protected Vault-Tec information, the following security procedures have now been
    instituted:<br><br>

    1. Shutdown of the VTMB01 Masterbrain requires authorization from all three System Operator terminals.<br><br>

    2. All materials of a sensitive nature have been removed from external terminals and access to the Mainframe Room
    requires authorization from all three System Operator terminals.<br><br>

    3. All mechanized security is now being handled by the VTMB01 Masterbrain via security uplink. Please do not tamper
    with this unit without an authorized Service Technician present.<br><br>
